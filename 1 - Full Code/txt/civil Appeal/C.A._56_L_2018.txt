Date of Hearing

ORDER

Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned Sr. ASC who

appeared on behalf of the Appellant in Civil Appeal

No.56-L of 2018 has been heard. The question of

the maintainability of the instant appeals against

the judgment of the learned Single Bench of the

Lahore High Court, Lahore filed in the absence of

Intra Court Appeals having been filed in terms of

Section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 is in

issue. The question of the locus standi of the

Appellant, who is the Speaker, National Assembly of

Pakistan also needs to be determined.

2.

The lis in the instant cases primarily

revolves around the Nomination Forms for

CA Nos.56-L-2018 etc.

4

candidates of the National Assembly and Provincial

Assemblies issued in terms of Elections Act, 2017

and the omissions therein when compared with the

such Nomination Forms issued in terms of

Representation of the People Act, 1976 (ROPA)

(since repealed). The adjudication in this behalf

requires interpretation of various provisions of the

Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,

1973 including Articles 62, 63, 218 to 222,

therefore, notice is issued to the learned Attorney

General for Pakistan in terms of Order XXVII-A

CPC.

3.

Today, the question of interim relief needs

to be examined. On the last date of hearing, while

granting leave to appeal, operation of the impugned

judgment was also suspended without hearing the

opposite side. With regard to the information

omitted from the Nomination Papers and Form A &

B, as issued in terms of Elections Act, 2017, when

examined in juxtaposition with the requirement of

the Nomination Forms previously in vogue under

the ROPA, 1976, it appears that the information, no

CA Nos.56-L-2018 etc.

5

longer required to be disclosed, prima facie, would

facilitate the determination of the qualification or

disqualification of a candidate and would lead to

greater transparency regarding the credentials of a

candidate facilitating the electorate in making a

more informative choice.

4.

In the above backdrop, on Court query,

the learned Sr. ASC for the Appellant stated that

neither his client (Speaker of the National Assembly)

nor the Political Party to which his client belonged

has any objection to the disclosure of said

additional information and the leadership of such

political party has come on record in this behalf.

However, as per his contentions, some of such

information previously required in the Nomination

Forms is not really necessary. With his assistance,

we examined each and every omitted clause of the

Nomination Forms issued under ROPA, 1976, The

learned counsel, at this stage, could not persuade

us that such disclosure in any manner would

prejudice any candidate. At best, some information

may perhaps be unnecessary or surplus.

CA Nos.56-L-2018 etc.

6

5.

As an interim measure, we believe that

such additional information, which was required to

be disclosed through the Nomination Papers &

Forms under ROPA, 1976 and now omitted through

Nomination Papers contemplated by the Elections

Act, 2017 must be disclosed by a candidate. Such

disclosure is necessary to ensure the sanctity and

integrity of the General Elections, 2018, as if the

instant appeals eventually fail, complications in this

behalf may arise. The learned counsel for the ECP

also supports such interim measures.

6.

Mr. Babar Yaqoob Fateh, Secretary,

Election Commission of Pakistan present in the

Court was directed to prepare a draft Affidavit to be

submitted by a Candidate disclosing the requisite

information omitted by the Elections Act, 2017.

Such draft affidavit was made available and is

reproduced herein below, which shall form part of

this order:-
