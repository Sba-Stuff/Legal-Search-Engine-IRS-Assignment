ORDER MIAN SAQIB NISAR, CJ.- Leave to appeal is granted in

these petitions to consider, inter alia, the following points:-

i.

Whether in a case where there is a statutory ouster of

constitutional jurisdiction to grant bail can be invoked on

the same principles or grounds as are available under the

general law?

ii.

Whether the judgment dated 03.08.2016 in C.P.

NAB" and Judgment dated 28.11.2014 passed in C.P.

No.1305/2014 titled as "Muhammad Arshad Vs. Tassaduq

Hussain @ Mittu and other" is per incuriam as per the ratio

of the cases reported as Haji Ghulam Ali Vs. The State

through A.G., N.W.F.P., Peshawar and another (2003

SCMR 597), Abdul Aziz Khan Niazi Vs. The State through

iii.

Whether the scope of the constitutional jurisdiction for grant

of bail during investigation/trial or release on bail by way of

suspension of sentence is much wider than the scope of

grant of bail under the general law, or otherwise?

iv.

What are the parameters of tentative assessment of evidence

and how can it be differentiated from the deeper appreciation

of evidence particularly in cases involving grant of bail by

suspending the sentence and release on bail during

pendency of the appeal?

v.

Whether the guidelines provided by the Superior Courts

regarding ouster of Section 426 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C.) are required to be followed for the

suspension of sentence in cases of NAB? If so, what are the

principles regulating suspension of the sentence under

Section 426 Cr.P.C.?

vi.

Whether the principles regulating bail under Sections 497

and 498 Cr.P.C. would also be applicable while considering

the matter of suspension of sentence?

happily worded, what would be the effect thereof?

Whether the ground of hardship can be considered while suspending the sentence in a NAB case?
Whether the merits of a case can be discussed and conclusive findings be given, as done by the learned Islamabad High Court in its order dated 19.09.2018, are permissible in its constitutional jurisdiction while dealing with cases of suspension of sentence?
Whether in a constitutional petition, a miscellaneous application filed under Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. can be filed for adjudication where the Cr.P.C. is not applicable?
Whether the learned Islamabad High Court can take up the constitutional petition when the main appeals were already fixed for hearing?
Whether a detailed order (consisting of 41 pages) is permissible while dealing with the suspension of sentence?
Whether or not the learned Islamabad High Court has ignored the guidelines laid down by this Court in case reported as Muhammad Shakeel Vs. The State and others (PLD 2014 SC 458)?
Whether the learned Islamabad High Court has properly interpreted the provisions of Sections 9(a)(v) and 14(c) (first and second part) of the Ordinance read with Articles 117, 122 to 129 of the Qanun-i-Shahadat Order, 1984 with regards to burden of proof and presumption?
