ORDER

IJAZ UL AHSAN, J. ­ Petitioner seeks leave to appeal

against a judgment dated 24.01.2018 passed by a learned Division

Bench of the Lahore High Court in Income Tax Reference No.20 of 2017.

2.

The brief facts necessary for decision of this lis are that

proceedings under Section 122(C) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001

("the Ordinance") were initiated against the petitioner and a demand in

the sum of Rs.3.3 million was created. The petitioner failed to deposit the

said amount, in consequence whereof, notice under section 137(2) read

with Section 138(1)/140 of the Ordinance was issued to him. He filed his

income tax return, wealth statement, wealth reconciliation statement and

written explanation. The documents filed by the petitioner were not

found satisfactory by the department. Consequently, notice under

Section 122(9) was issued to him. The petitioner filed a response which

was again not found satisfactory by the department. On the basis of

C.P.945/2018

-: 2 :-

material available with the department, it was held that the petitioner

was engaged in the real estate business without having been registered

as a taxpayer. The department proceeded to amend the assessment

making an addition of Rs.60,360,912/- under Section 111(1)(b) for the

subsequent tax year. Being aggrieved, the petitioner filed an appeal

which did not find favour with the Appellate Authority and was

dismissed. The appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue

(ATIR) did not succeed either. The petitioner therefore, approached the

High Court by way of a reference under the Ordinance. Vide order dated

24.01.2018 relief was denied to the petitioner. Hence, this petition for

leave to appeal.

3.

Although three questions were referred to the learned High

Court for its opinion, the first question was not pressed. Therefore, no

opinion was expressed by the learned High Court on the said question.

4.

The learned High Court expressed its opinion on questions

No.2 and 3 which for ease of reference are reproduced below: -

"2. Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the learned ATIR was justified to uphold an addition made under section 18 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 against its every spirit as explained in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001?

3. Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case learned ATIR was justified in not considering the additions made under section 111(1)(b) of Income Tax Ordinance 2001 in the income of a Tax Year to which these are not related to therefore are in violation of section 111(1)(b) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001?"

5.

The learned High Court answered question No.2 in the

"negative", whereas question No.1 in the "affirmative".

6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that by virtue of

Section 37(1)(A) of the Ordinance, the petitioner was not liable to pay

Capital Gains Tax as the property was purchased in the year 2008 and

sold in the year 2013. He maintains that the lower fora fell in error in

C.P.945/2018

-: 3 :-

treating the sale consideration of the property as business income of the

petitioner under Section 18 of the Ordinance.

7.

With reference to question No.3 the learned counsel submits

that by virtue of Section 111(1)(b) of the Ordinance there was no

justification for adding Rs.60 million in the accumulative wealth of the

petitioner for the year 2013. He maintains that Section 111(2) of the

Ordinance only permits inclusion of the amounts mentioned in sub-

section (1) of Section 111 in the person's income chargeable to tax, in the

tax year to which such amount relates. He maintains that the petitioner

filed his return for the first time in 2013. As such, the amount of wealth

shown for the year 2012 amounting to Rs.60 million could not be taxed

in terms of Section 111(2) of the Ordinance by treating it as an

investment for the tax year 2013.

8.

We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and

examined the record. As far as inapplicability of Section 18 of the

Ordinance is concerned, we find that the same deals with business

income. However, Section 37(1)(A) read with Division VIII of Part 1 of the

First Schedule provides that where holding period of immovable property

is more than two years, the rate of capital gains shall be zero percent.

The department however, found that the petitioner was engaged in the

real estate business for a number of years before 2014 which is the year

the petitioner claimed that he started his business of real estate. In this

regard, the department relied upon the material (which was not rebutted)

indicating that the petitioner had been engaged in the real estate

business for many years before 2014. Consequently, it was correctly held

that the benefit of zero percent capital gains tax was not available to the

petitioner on the sale and purchase of property in the absence of reliable

material necessary to avail the benefit of Section 37(1)(A) ibid.

C.P.945/2018

-: 4 :-

9.

We also notice that the addition of Rs.60 million was made

in the taxable income of the petitioner under Section 111(1)(b) of the

Ordinance on account of the petitioner's failure to furnish material in

support of his defence during reconciliation proceedings. The said

provisions stipulate that where a person fails to offer a satisfactory

explanation about the nature and source of the investment, the value of

the investment shall be included in the person's income chargeable to

tax to the extent it is not adequately explained.

10.

The learned counsel for the petitioner heavily relied upon

Section 111(1)(2) to contend that only wealth for the year 2013 could be

added to the income tax of the petitioner for the purposes of tax in view

of the specific language of the said section. The record indicates that the

petitioner had shown his net wealth as of 30.06.2013 to be

Rs.64,346,112/-. However, the department was not satisfied with the

veracity of the return and called upon him through show cause notice to

explain net wealth amounting to Rs.60,360,912/- as on 30.06.2012

which had remained unexplained. Although he submitted his reply but

the same was neither satisfactory nor did it substantiate his source of

investment. It is also significant that the petitioner had all along taken

the stance that he had started his real estate business in 2014 and as

such he could not be assessed for the year 2013. We have specifically

asked the learned counsel for the petitioner to explain the accretion of

net wealth as on 30.06.2012. However, he has not been able to refer to

any material that may even remotely explain such accretion. We are,

therefore, satisfied that the findings of the subordinate fora that the said

accretion was chargeable to tax for the year 2013 do not suffer from any

error of interpretation or application of the afore-noted provisions of law.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to convince us

that the judgments of the High Court or the Appellate fora suffer from

C.P.945/2018

-: 5 :-

any legal, procedural or jurisdictional error or flaw calling for interference

by this Court in terms of Article 185(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic

Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

11.

For reasons recorded above, we do not find any merit in this

petition. It is accordingly dismissed. Leave to appeal is refused.
